# Subnet
---

This template creates just one subnet.

It may create a new Virtual Network, or refer to an existing one.
It also may create a basic NSG, consisting only a SSH rule, or refer to an existing one.

It also may also associate to a NAT Gateway, if you specify a `natGatewayName` parameter.
